Technical Challenge 2 for Toppan Security

1) Browse for an image. It will show up in the UI as confirmation.
2) Click upload to send a POST request to the image upload controller which saves the image to a folder.
3) The webpage will read the image(s) in the folder. As of now, only one image is saved to a fixed file name so only one image will be shown at all times.
